# initiate
Try to make conversation on some port.

# Description
We want to communicate to unknown number protocols.
So F_p^n input F_p^m output chain is made (However F_p^n as a input can be unknown from input or algorithm theirselves), so if there's some secure socket or so, we must fails with the communication because of the number.
We calculate random or serialized input into F_p^n, then, calculate entropy or pattern match or so from output and dump them.
